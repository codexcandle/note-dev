<ul>
<li><code>80% of mix comes from volume balance.</code></li>
<li><code>loop the loudest section of the song.</code></li>
<li><p><code>start with the &quot;global&quot; song components:</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>- mix buss processing
- group processing
- volume balance</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>avoid the solo btn.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>- if you&#39;re making decisions w/o the
context of the mix, will probably lead
to bad decisions
- &#39;I can&#39;t do it unless I solo the
channel?&#39; - just increase the dB value
on that channel (temporarily) instead
to keep it in context with the mix.</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>have an intention behind every move.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>- what (are you trying to achieve)?
- why (are you trying to do that)?
- how (am I going to do that)?</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>use the bypass btn often.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>- focus on effect on the mix.
- try closing eyes, to trick yourself
&amp; toggle the AB switch several times
to lose track of it&#39;s enabled state,
to see if you prefer the sound in its
current state; open eyes to confirm!</code></pre></li>
<li><code>use good (&amp; more than 1) reference tracks.</code></li>
<li><p><code>mix in mono for the majority of your mix.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>- only start adjusting panning after
mix sounds great in mono (as will open &amp; add
a bunch of depth of track).
- there&#39;s normally a plugin in every
daw that has a mono switch to put
on the master fader.</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>listen back on multiple speakers.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>every time you switch, you&#39;re resetting your ears &amp;
getting a fresh (objective) perspective.</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>mix at a low (conversational) volume.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>any louder is too loud.</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>take regular breaks.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>every 30-45 mins for 5-10 mins.</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>assume that volume automation is still needed for the song.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>rest assured; can add later to help automate balance of various tracks.</code></pre></li>
<li><code>use bussing to save time &amp; create cohesion.</code></li>
<li><p><code>create a stereo slapback delay for vocals &amp; melodies.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>- is a great way of getting a sense
of space w/o pushing the vocal back (e.g. reverb)
- send a vocal to an aux track - with just this
slapback on it (just 10-20%? wet?), and notice how
the vocal will sound more natural, upfront, but more cohesive
in the mix (vs. washing out with reverb)</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>use 2 room reverbs to add cohesion.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>- 1st reverb to push instru&#39;s back in the mix (named &quot;Ambience&quot;).
- 2nd to get that cohesive room tone (called &quot;RoomVerb&quot;).
- remember you&#39;ll usually shoot for having all instrus
send to these reverb aux buss&#39; (to varying amounts) - to
achieve a cohesive sound (as all the various parts may have
been recorded by different artists in different spaces).
- &quot;early reflections&quot; tell the ear how close / far
something is (e.g. &quot;Ambience&quot; aux channel).
- &quot;late reflections&quot; tell the ear what the room sounds
like (e.g. &quot;RoomVerb&quot;)</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>use serial compression for control &amp; tone.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>- entails using 2-3 light compressors in a row - to prevent
squashed sound.
- instead of 1 compressor reducing by 10 dB -
use 3 compressors in serial reducing by 3 dB each -
and b/c each compressor isn&#39;t working as hard -
will give much more natural sound.
- try use varying attack &amp; release times!
- could use a fast attack on the 1st to catch the transients,
w/ maybe less quick setting for other 2 to help &quot;shape&quot; the tone.</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>focus on your volume balance.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>- if you have a good mix, but a shaker in bg that&#39;s only
4 dB too loud - will ruin mix, making everything sound
out-of-balance.
- focus on volume 1st for all parts, &amp; get as good as possible
before reaching for any processing.
- use concept of &quot;height order&quot; - when the loudest part of the
song is looped, everything gets turned down except the most
important element which is put at -5dB; so e.g. start
with kick (assuming is most important element of the song), bring
it up to -5dB, then bring up next most important element,
slowly up it&#39;s volume until it sounds like it matches in
the mix.
- subsequent processing / adjustments will shift volume balance
out of whack, but will be an iterative process as you go to
adjust the volume balance.</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>use an organizational plan to avoid choice fatigue.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>- making choices uses up physical energy.
- try &quot;5 drivers of mixing&quot; strategy:
    * #1 balance (volume)
    * #2 fix (remove bad resonant freqs, etc)
    * #3 enhance (make it sound &quot;cool&quot;)
    * #4 shape (remove bass on guitar to make room for etc, push mids down here)
    * #5 space (go from 2d to 3d)...&amp; as is best to mix mostly in mono anyhow -
        for a tigher sound, to address phasing issues that arise when summing
        stereo sound to mono signal; don&#39;t use panning until this final step!</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>try to get your track around 0dBVU.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>- most digital gear is even modeled after old analogue gear - where this
volume level was the sweet spot.)
- think volume on main bus is different?
- in order to &quot;gain stage&quot; a track, need 2 tools:
    * #1 vu meter (many free ones, e.g. waves)
    * #2 gainer / trimmer
    * gainer (then) vu meter
    * so you solo track, watch meter, and adjust gain until
    track somewhat peaks aorund 0 dB.
    * do these for EACH of your tracks.</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>use daw's &quot;marquee&quot; tool.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>- allows you to instantly highlight a segment, and it &quot;cuts&quot; the segment
    for you, allowing you to:
        * #1 no longer need to draw volume automation, just highlight, &amp; grab
        handles for volume lane and drag down.
        * #2 serves as a great cutting tool for sample mangling.</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>learn keyboard shortcuts.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>w/ ear / choice fatigue; hurry it up; longer you sit, more chance
your mix will end up poor.</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>save a copy of your mix before you start mixing.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>to compare / be confident your efforts are leading to a better product.</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>panning automation is just as important as volume automation.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>&quot;if a song is 100% stereo all the time, then it&#39;s
0% stereo.&quot; (i.e. there&#39;s no impact, change to the listener)</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>use your daw's nudge tool.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>- to employ nudging - moving the regions as needed, by even as few
as just 10 ms (or more) to get your instrus to sound &quot;in the pocket.&quot;
- use x-fades to ensure pops aren&#39;t introduced by new region
placements / potential overlaps.</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>use quantize strength to keep the humanity of your midi.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>try 50-60%?</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>the higher the quality the initial recording, the higher the mixing potential.</code></p>
<pre class="txt"><code>if it&#39;s recorded bad, the mix will only sound decent at best.</code></pre></li>
