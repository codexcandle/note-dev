## Sleep

### white-noise <a name="white-noise"></a>\

* our brains continue to process sounds while we're asleep. This is why noie can wake us.  So if you want to get rid of all the sounds in (& around) your bedroom, a noise-machine might help.  White noise works by drowing out the dispuptive sounds that might wake us up.  And because the sound is steady but unpredictable - it gently captivates our attention without requiring any real focus.

> "It's an ambient noise that passes through our consciousness and doesn't really arose any emotion."

* even people who seemingly aren't bothered by nighttime sound can move between different sleep stages, and expereince changes in heart rate & blood pressure when they hear noise.

* when you're asleep, the brain is still taking in auditory input, and processing it in a rudiamentary way.  The brain is actively hearing (-just not to the point where you can learn to speak Spanish in your sleep!)

* researchers played audio of someone reading a list of words while they slept.  They found that sleeping participants' brains automatically categorized the words being read as either "verbs" or "colors."

* white noise is certainly no magic potion as some people have found that it actually increases their sensitivity to the underlying sounds it's trying to block.

### pink-noise <a name="pink-noise"></a>\

* similar to white noise, pink noise helps to mask annoying & intrusive sounds.  The important difference between the two is that the stress-inducing, high-pitched frequencies found in white noise are filtered out of pink noise!

### vestibular vibrations <a name="vestibular-vibrations"></a>\

* as the vestibular system is a sensory system that detects motion & helps us keep our balance.  Interestingly, it's also hard-wired to the sleep network in our brain - "the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the master clock in charge of regulating our circadian rhythms, and a region in the hypothalamus that's host to a stimulation-inducing neuropeptide called orexin.

* high-amplitude vibrations picked up by the vestibular system stimulate alertness, while low-amplitude vibrations make us sleepy.  What NASA research revealed is that motions such as rocking or riding in a car are not the only way to deliver low-amplitude vibrations - we can do the same thing with sound!

## Humans & Beat <a name="humans&beat"></a>\

---

* aside from songbirds, humans are the only creatures that automatically feel the beat of a song.  Music entrains our bodies - physically by actiating the muscle-control centers of our brains that gets us moving to the rhythm, and emotionally by guiding our moods into synchonicity with its own tone.

## Meaningful & Beautiful <a name="meaningful&beautiful"></a>\

---

* when the sound is meaningful & beautiful, our brains become more organized & integrated.  When the sounds are chaotic & stressful, our brains struggle with basic functions.
