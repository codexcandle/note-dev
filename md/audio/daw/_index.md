## The Discipline <a name="discipline"></a>

---

1. `block out distractions` (e.g. turn off wifi/internet).
2. `map out the intended sections of your track FIRST` (using locators), then write it out.
3. `write enticing B SECTIONs` (to accompany your main drop a-section).
4. `don't get stuck on small details` (e.g. 1-hr tweaking hi-hat when you're supposed to be in the song-making phase).
5. `break your workflow into different sections` (sound-design on 1st day, then come back & only use those sounds to then write your track, then mix on another day).
6. `plan the mood of your track` (e.g. to assist, try laying down some chord progressions 1st).
7. `don't give up` without properly exploring new ideas.
8. `take breaks` (e.g. once every 45 mins, take a break for 5 mins).
9. `focus on the finishing touches` (e.g. lil transitions, fills, final-product touches, polish).
10. `prioritize music-production` in your life.
