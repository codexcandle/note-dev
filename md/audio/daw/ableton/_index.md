1. leaving yourself open to distractions. (turn off wifi/internet)
2. map out (using LOCATORS) the "intended" sections of your track FIRST, then write it out.
3. know how to write how an enticing B SECTION (to your main drop A SECTION)
4. don't stuck on small details (1hr tweaking hi-hat when you're SUPPOSED to be in the song-making phase)
5. break up your workflow into different sections (sound-design on one day, then come back and ONLY USE SOUNDS YOU MADE BEFORE to then write your track, then mix another.
6. be precise with your planned "mood" of the track.  (chord progressions are great for this.  lay these down, and the track will come to you.)
7. don't give up without properly exploring new ideas.
8. take breaks (once every 45 mins, take a break for 5 mins)
9. put effort into the FINISHING TOUCHES that makes a track sound POLISHED.  VERY IMPORTANT, lil transitions, lil fills, final product).
10. prioritize MUSIC PRODUCTION in your life.
