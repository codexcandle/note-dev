## Tips <a name="tips"></a>

---

* `80% of mix comes from volume balance.`
* `loop the loudest section of the song.`
* `start with the "global" song components:`

	```txt
	- mix buss processing
	- group processing
	- volume balance
	```

* `avoid the solo btn.`

	```txt
	- if you're making decisions w/o the
context of the mix, will probably lead
to bad decisions!
	- 'I can't do it unless I solo the
channel?' - just increase the dB value
on that channel (temporarily) instead 
to keep it in context with the mix.
	```

* `have an intention behind every move.`

	```txt
	- "what why how"
	- what (are you trying to achieve)?
	- why (are you trying to do that)?
	- how (am I going to do that)?
	```

* `use the bypass btn often.`

	```txt
	- focus on effect on the mix.
	- try closing eyes, to trick yourself
	& toggle the AB switch several times
	to lose track of it's enabled state,
	to see if you prefer the sound in its
	current state; open eyes to confirm!
	```

* `use good (& more than 1) reference tracks.`
* `mix in mono for the majority of your mix.`

	```txt
	- only start adjusting panning after
	mix sounds great in mono (as will open & add
	a bunch of depth of track).
	- there's normally a plugin in every
	daw that has a mono switch to put
	on the master fader.
	```

* `listen back on multiple speakers.`

	```txt
	every time you switch, you're
	resetting your ears & getting a
	fresh (objective) perspective.
	```

* `mix at a low (conversational) volume.`

	```txt
	any louder is too loud.
	```

* `take regular breaks.`

	```txt
	every 30-45 mins for 5-10 mins.
	```

* `assume that volume automation is
still needed for the song.`

	```txt
	rest assured, as can add that later to
	help automate the balance of the various
	song tracks.
	```
