## Tips <a name="tips"></a>

* `80% of mix comes from volume balance.`
* `loop the loudest section of the song.`
* `start with the "global" song components:`

	```txt
	- mix buss processing
	- group processing
	- volume balance
	```

* `avoid the solo btn.`

	```txt
	- if you're making decisions w/o the
context of the mix, will probably lead
to bad decisions
	- 'I can't do it unless I solo the
channel?' - just increase the dB value
on that channel (temporarily) instead
to keep it in context with the mix.
	```

* `have an intention behind every move.`

	```txt
	- what (are you trying to achieve)?
	- why (are you trying to do that)?
	- how (am I going to do that)?
	```

* `use the bypass btn often.`

	```txt
	- focus on effect on the mix.
	- try closing eyes, to trick yourself
	& toggle the AB switch several times
	to lose track of it's enabled state,
	to see if you prefer the sound in its
	current state; open eyes to confirm!
	```

* `use good (& more than 1) reference tracks.`
* `mix in mono for the majority of your mix.`

	```txt
	- only start adjusting panning after
	mix sounds great in mono (as will open & add
	a bunch of depth of track).
	- there's normally a plugin in every
	daw that has a mono switch to put
	on the master fader.
	```

* `listen back on multiple speakers.`

	```txt
	every time you switch, you're resetting your ears &
	getting a fresh (objective) perspective.
	```

* `mix at a low (conversational) volume.`

	```txt
	any louder is too loud.
	```

* `take regular breaks.`

	```txt
	every 30-45 mins for 5-10 mins.
	```

* `assume that volume automation is still needed for the song.`

	```txt
	rest assured; can add later to help automate balance of various tracks.
	```

* `use bussing to save time & create cohesion.`
* `create a stereo slapback delay for vocals & melodies.`

	```txt
	- is a great way of getting a sense
	of space w/o pushing the vocal back (e.g. reverb)
	- send a vocal to an aux track - with just this
	slapback on it (just 10-20%? wet?), and notice how
	the vocal will sound more natural, upfront, but more cohesive
	in the mix (vs. washing out with reverb)
	```

* `use 2 room reverbs to add cohesion.`

	```txt
	- 1st reverb to push instru's back in the mix (named "Ambience").
	- 2nd to get that cohesive room tone (called "RoomVerb").
	- remember you'll usually shoot for having all instrus
	send to these reverb aux buss' (to varying amounts) - to
	achieve a cohesive sound (as all the various parts may have
	been recorded by different artists in different spaces).
	- "early reflections" tell the ear how close / far
	something is (e.g. "Ambience" aux channel).
	- "late reflections" tell the ear what the room sounds
	like (e.g. "RoomVerb")
	```

* `use serial compression for control & tone.`

	```txt
	- entails using 2-3 light compressors in a row - to prevent
	squashed sound.
	- instead of 1 compressor reducing by 10 dB -
	use 3 compressors in serial reducing by 3 dB each -
	and b/c each compressor isn't working as hard -
	will give much more natural sound.
	- try use varying attack & release times!
	- could use a fast attack on the 1st to catch the transients,
	w/ maybe less quick setting for other 2 to help "shape" the tone.
	```

* `focus on your volume balance.`

	```txt
	- if you have a good mix, but a shaker in bg that's only
	4 dB too loud - will ruin mix, making everything sound
	out-of-balance.
	- focus on volume 1st for all parts, & get as good as possible
	before reaching for any processing.
	- use concept of "height order" - when the loudest part of the
	song is looped, everything gets turned down except the most
	important element which is put at -5dB; so e.g. start
	with kick (assuming is most important element of the song), bring
	it up to -5dB, then bring up next most important element,
	slowly up it's volume until it sounds like it matches in
	the mix.
	- subsequent processing / adjustments will shift volume balance
	out of whack, but will be an iterative process as you go to
	adjust the volume balance.
	```

* `use an organizational plan to avoid choice fatigue.`

	```txt
	- making choices uses up physical energy.
	- try "5 drivers of mixing" strategy:
		* #1 balance (volume)
		* #2 fix (remove bad resonant freqs, etc)
		* #3 enhance (make it sound "cool")
		* #4 shape (remove bass on guitar to make room for etc, push mids down here)
		* #5 space (go from 2d to 3d)...& as is best to mix mostly in mono anyhow -
			for a tigher sound, to address phasing issues that arise when summing
			stereo sound to mono signal; don't use panning until this final step!
	```

* `try to get your track around 0dBVU.`

	```txt
	- most digital gear is even modeled after old analogue gear - where this
	volume level was the sweet spot.)
	- think volume on main bus is different?
	- in order to "gain stage" a track, need 2 tools:
		* #1 vu meter (many free ones, e.g. waves)
		* #2 gainer / trimmer
		* gainer (then) vu meter
		* so you solo track, watch meter, and adjust gain until
		track somewhat peaks aorund 0 dB.
		* do these for EACH of your tracks.
	```

* `use daw's "marquee" tool.`

	```txt
	- allows you to instantly highlight a segment, and it "cuts" the segment
		for you, allowing you to:
			* #1 no longer need to draw volume automation, just highlight, & grab
			handles for volume lane and drag down.
			* #2 serves as a great cutting tool for sample mangling.
	```

* `learn keyboard shortcuts.`

	```txt
	w/ ear / choice fatigue; hurry it up; longer you sit, more chance
	your mix will end up poor.
	```

* `save a copy of your mix before you start mixing.`

	```txt
	to compare / be confident your efforts are leading to a better product.
	```

* `panning automation is just as important as volume automation.`

	```txt
	"if a song is 100% stereo all the time, then it's
	0% stereo." (i.e. there's no impact, change to the listener)
	```

* `use your daw's nudge tool.`

	```txt
	- to employ nudging - moving the regions as needed, by even as few
	as just 10 ms (or more) to get your instrus to sound "in the pocket."
	- use x-fades to ensure pops aren't introduced by new region
	placements / potential overlaps.
	```

* `use quantize strength to keep the humanity of your midi.`

	```txt
	try 50-60%?
	```

* `the higher the quality the initial recording, the higher the mixing potential.`

	```txt
	if it's recorded bad, the mix will only sound decent at best.
	```
