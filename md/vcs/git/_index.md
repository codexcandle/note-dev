* `pros`

    1.  `nearly every operation is local` - most operations in Git need only local files & resources to operate — generally no information is needed from another computer on your network.
    2. `git has integrity` - everything in Git is checksummed before it is stored & is then referred to by that checksum. This means it’s impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it.
