<ul>
<li>our brains continue to process sounds while we’re asleep. This is why noie can wake us. So if you want to get rid of all the sounds in (&amp; around) your bedroom, a noise-machine might help. White noise works by drowing out the dispuptive sounds that might wake us up. And because the sound is steady but unpredictable - it gently captivates our attention without requiring any real focus.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s an ambient noise that passes through our consciousness and doesn’t really arose any emotion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>even people who seemingly aren’t bothered by nighttime sound can move between different sleep stages, and expereince changes in heart rate &amp; blood pressure when they hear noise.</p></li>
<li><p>when you’re asleep, the brain is still taking in auditory input, and processing it in a rudiamentary way. The brain is actively hearing (-just not to the point where you can learn to speak Spanish in your sleep!)</p></li>
<li><p>researchers played audio of someone reading a list of words while they slept. They found that sleeping participants’ brains automatically categorized the words being read as either “verbs” or “colors.”</p></li>
<li><p>white noise is certainly no magic potion as some people have found that it actually increases their sensitivity to the underlying sounds it’s trying to block.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pink-noise">pink-noise <a name="pink-noise"></a><br />
</h3>
<ul>
<li>similar to white noise, pink noise helps to mask annoying &amp; intrusive sounds. The important difference between the two is that the stress-inducing, high-pitched frequencies found in white noise are filtered out of pink noise!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vestibular-vibrations">vestibular vibrations <a name="vestibular-vibrations"></a><br />
</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>as the vestibular system is a sensory system that detects motion &amp; helps us keep our balance. Interestingly, it’s also hard-wired to the sleep network in our brain - &quot;the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the master clock in charge of regulating our circadian rhythms, and a region in the hypothalamus that’s host to a stimulation-inducing neuropeptide called orexin.</p></li>
<li><p>high-amplitude vibrations picked up by the vestibular system stimulate alertness, while low-amplitude vibrations make us sleepy. What NASA research revealed is that motions such as rocking or riding in a car are not the only way to deliver low-amplitude vibrations - we can do the same thing with sound!</p></li>

</h2>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>aside from songbirds, humans are the only creatures that automatically feel the beat of a song. Music entrains our bodies - physically by actiating the muscle-control centers of our brains that gets us moving to the rhythm, and emotionally by guiding our moods into synchonicity with its own tone.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="meaningful-beautiful">Meaningful &amp; Beautiful <a name="meaningful&beautiful"></a><br />
</h2>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>when the sound is meaningful &amp; beautiful, our brains become more organized &amp; integrated. When the sounds are chaotic &amp; stressful, our brains struggle with basic functions.</li>
